# Predictive_Modeling_of_LungCancer-A_DeepLearning_Approach

The aim of this project is to demonstrate that deep learning models can significantly enhance the predictive modeling of lung cancer, leading to earlier detection and better-informed treatment decisions. 

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to develop predictive models capable of identifying lung cancer from medical imaging data(chest X-rays ).

Steps are:

          Data Collection
                          Gather a dataset of lung cancer images.
                          
          Data Preprocessing
                          Normalize the images to prepare them for model training.
                          
          Model Development
                          Apply CNN architecture, suitable for the dataset.
                          
          Model Training
                          Train the CNN model using the training set and optimize it based on validation set performance.
                          
          Model Evaluation
                          Evaluate the model's performance using test set metrics like accuracy.
